# Significantly Less Nifty Chat: An Edit of Nifty Chat Monitor

Userscript for Grease/Tampermonkey to inline images in Twitch chat. It does nothing else.

### Features
- inlines linked images

## Installation
- Install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox Only) extension for your browser
- [View the Raw JS Script File](https://github.com/Road-hog123/significantly-less-nifty-chat/raw/master/chat-monitor.user.js), Tampermonkey will detect that you're opening a userscript and prompt to install it
- If it doesn't, you can copy the contents of the Raw JS file into a new Tampermonkey userscript

## Usage
Unlike the Nifty Chat Monitor script, this userscript works without any url changes.
Note that a link must be to an image (end in an image file extension) and not involve ports.
